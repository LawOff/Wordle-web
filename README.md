## Introduction 👋
Simple classic Wordle game. Made in between classes so as not to forget my web devs basics and try out a few new tricks including sweetalert, xios and DOM manipulations.

## Features 🌟
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Enjoy a familiar Wordle experience with a French vocabulary twist.
- **Stylish Interface**: A clean and modern design powered by Tailwind CSS.
- **Responsive Design**: Playable on various devices, thanks to responsive web design.
- **Simple to Use**: Easy-to-understand controls for a user-friendly experience.

## How to Play 🎲
Guess the correct French word in five tries. After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

- 🟩: The letter is in the word and in the correct spot.
- 🟨: The letter is in the word but in the wrong spot.
- 🔴: The letter is not in the word in any spot.

## Installation 🛠️
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/french-wordle-game.git
   ```
2. Open index.html in your browser to start playing!

## How It Works 🤖
The game logic is implemented in JavaScript, using DOM manipulation to interact with the grid and Axios for any HTTP requests. A list of French words is loaded from words.txt, and the game randomly selects a target word for each new game session.
It use tailwindcss for the render, and sweetalert for the popups.
